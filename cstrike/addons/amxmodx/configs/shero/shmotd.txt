<b>How to get Heroes:</b>
As you kill opponents you gain Experience Points (XP), once you have
accumulated enough for a level up you will be able to choose a hero.
The higher the level of the person you kill the more XP you get.
The default starting point is level 0 and you cannot select any heroes.

<b>How to use Binds:</b>
To use some hero's powers you have to bind a key to:
	+power#

In order to bind a key you must open your console and use the bind command:
	bind "key" "command"

In this case the command is "+power#". Here are some examples:
	bind f +power1		bind MOUSE3 +power2
